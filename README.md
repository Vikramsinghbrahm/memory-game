A console-based memory game written in Python.

## Description

This project implements a simple console-based memory game using Python. Players can test their memory by uncovering hidden pairs of numbers in a grid.

## Features

- Option to reveal the entire grid.
- Menu-based interaction for playing the game.
- Object-oriented design for grid management.
- Scoring system based on the number of guesses.

    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd memory-game
    ```

3. Run the game with the desired grid size (replace `4` with your preferred size):
